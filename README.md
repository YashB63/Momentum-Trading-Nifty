# Momentum-Trading-Nifty
Momentum trading is a strategy used in financial markets where traders aim to capitalize on the continued upward or downward movement of an asset's price.

 It is based on the principle that assets that have been trending strongly in one direction are likely to continue in that direction for a certain period.
